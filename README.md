# Using-Rick-and-Morty-Api

This project was created as a homework at Scoala Informala de IT

## Description

For this project we had to solve the following:

- A generic function that uses fetch to GET an URL and return the responses
- A function that can GET all characters or a single character (endpoint: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#character) - needs to call the generic function
- A function that can GET all locations or a single location (endpoint: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#location) - needs to call the generic function
- A function that can GET all episodes or a single episode (endpoint: https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#episode) - needs to call the generic function

Function usages:

- Call the character function to fetch all characters and 3 individual calls to get a single character
- Call the location function to fetch all characters and 3 individual calls to get a single location
- Call the episode function to fetch all episodes and 3 individual calls to get a single episode
